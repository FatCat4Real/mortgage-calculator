1. I want to create a webapp using Reflex.
2. The app is based on the code @logic.py.
3. The app is a mortgage calculator that lets user adjust each parameter of the function @calculate_monthly_payment in @logic.py.
4. The app then outputs the following 
    4.1. How long does it take to pay off the mortgate (e.g. 40Y 10M)
    4.2. Total interest paid
    4.3. Total paid
    4.4. Average per month paid
